# Project Title

**End-to-End AI-Powered Drug Repositioning and Mechanism of Action Discovery**


## Overview

THe application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify potential new uses for existing drugs (drug repositioning) and elucidate their mechanisms of action (MOA). This project will involve extracting insights from scientific literature, patents, and clinical trial data, then generating hypotheses for drug-target interactions.
