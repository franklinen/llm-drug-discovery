# Project Title: AI-Powered Drug Repositioning and Mechanism of Action Discovery


## Overview

The recent Covid-19 pandemic made the clear the need to develop drug candidates faster to address immediate health needs. Some of the things we learned is that repositioning existing drugs can help to address immediate health concerns and also reduce the time of drug discovery. The application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify potential new uses for existing drugs (drug repositioning) and elucidate their mechanisms of action (MOA). This project will involve extracting insights from scientific literature, patents, and clinical trial data, then generating hypotheses for drug-target interactions.

## Background and Motivation

- The need to improve drug discovery turnaround time for epidemic situations(covid-19)
- The need to find cheaper drug alternatives for existing and new diseases
- The need to improve research projects on drug chemical compounds

## Goals

## Datasets

## Practical Applications

- Discovery of new drug targets
- Finding cheaper drug alternatives
- Starting point for academic research in drug discovery

## Milestones
